# COMP474
## Assignments By The Best Team in COMP 474 History

In this course, we have created a Knowledge Base using csv files containing course information from Concordia University, along with using the Apache Tika and Spotlight libraries to extract meaningful information from two courses (this can easily be upscaled by adding more relavent documents) using documents such as lecture slides and tutorial slides. With our robust knowledge base, we were then able to implement the open-source conversational AI Rasa, to answer 12 different questions about the courses.
